### A simple C# application using Windows forms GUI and connections to SQL and text files for data storage.

This application was made using a tutorial by Tim Corey (found at https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/csharp-mastercourse/). Where the original idea and much of the source code for the project is based.

Done in order to learn some fundamentals about syntax and class/interface usage within C#. This application contains a data connection interface which utilizes classes to connect to SQL and text files. The application can thus be brought out of Windows forms assuming the data fields are populated in the same ways otherwise (i.e. a web gui).

In working on this project I learned good practice in the formatting of C#, intelligent implementation of OOP principles and how to use SQL within the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (including programmed procedures).
